As long as you are on Windows and have mingw64 installed in the root directory of your C: drive, simply clone this and build/run with F5 in Visual Studio Code. Also includes the GLM math library. I eventually want to add build configurations for Linux and Mac.

Installing mingw64:

1. Go to https://www.mingw-w64.org/downloads/#mingw-w64-builds

2. Download the asset that best suits your needs. If you're unsure, just go with x86_64-15.1.0-release-posix-seh-ucrt-rt_v12-rev0.7z

3. Extract the file (with 7-Zip: https://www.7-zip.org/) into your C: drive. Make sure the folder is named mingw64
